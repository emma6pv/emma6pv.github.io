**Welcome to my GitHub Page! My name's Emma.**

I am an iOS engineer studying Human-Computer Interaction at UC Irvine. On the side, I host a funk & soul radio show [The Groove](https://kuci.org/wp/shows/the-groove/). I also make zines, some of which have been [archived](https://ls2pac.lapl.org/?section=resource&resourceid=1851847881) in the Los Angeles Public Library. 

**Below you'll find some of my latest projects.**

Feel free to reach out either through [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hapa.girl/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma6pv/). I love talking about tech ethics, Steve Buscemi, and vinyl records. Let's chat!
