## Introduction
Camp Tenacity is an iPhone and Watch app that encourages mindfulness through breathing exercises and games. Our mission is to create an engaging experience by giving the application a new modern and cohesive theme through the imagery of a campsite and addressing the UX pain points found in its predecessor.

Camp Tenacity is sponsored by Kurt Squire and the Connected Learning Lab. The application was created for the Winter 2020  Informatics Capstone by Emma Anderson, Michelle Lac, Kaitlyn Nguyen, Tiffany Nguyen, and Mandy Tsai. 

## Features

Through our development we added the following features:
* A game that helps you practice mindful breath-counting.
* A campsite that shows all achievements. This will be accessible through both the phone and the watch.
* An achievement system that allows users to earn camping items to populate the campsite.
* An achievement timeline that shows your achievement history and the timestamp for each achievement.
* Progress rings that track your progress against a preset goal.
* Charts that visualize the number of completed gameplays per day.
